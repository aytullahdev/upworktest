# <i class="fas join"></i>Join the Lab


All lab members must be:
- Decent human beings (we don’t work with jerks) 
- Interested in marine systems **and** using quantitative tools (e.g., mathematical models, statistics, R)
- Wanting to change the world

Members of the lab are strongly committed to anti-racist practices, real diversity and inclusion efforts, and moving science beyond the ivory tower.

## Commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity

One of my main commitments as a faculty member is promoting and supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM. Please consider applying for a position in my lab if you are a first-generation college student, a student from a low-income background, a member of a racial or ethnic minority group, if you identify as a woman or as LGBTQ+, and/or if you have a disability.


## Current opening: Data scientist/Research scientist/Research professor 

The Department of Biological Sciences at UNH is looking for a Data Scientist/Research Professor to join the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab with PI Easton White. This position would be at the MS or PhD level with compensation and title appropriate to each. 

1. Data Scientist: This person would work on several projects each year, including contributing to or leading publications. They would also provide informal mentorship to others in the lab and department.

2. Research Professor: An individual appointed at the research professor level would be involved in teaching, mentoring, grant writing, and working on publications. If appointed at the Research Professor position, the individual will be expected to take a leadership role in the lab and department. There will be substantial freedom to develop their own research program in addition to contributing to the larger mission of the QMEL. We envision this role as an alternative to the traditional pathway of a series of postdocs to a tenure-track position. 

This position is to start on a three-year contract with the possibility of extension. If you are interested, please send <Easton.White@unh.edu> a CV and brief introduction, including details of your prior research experience and why you might be a good fit for this position.

Qualifications

- Strong statistical, analytical, and data wrangling skills. Expertise in R, Tidyverse, time series analysis, Git/Github, and other open science tools
- Experience working with large datasets and/or at large spatial scales
- Evidence of a growing publication record consistent with the candidate’s career stage
- Experience teaching programming or statistics in formal or informal setting
- Experience with mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students
- Strong writing and communication skills
- Ability to work both independently and as a team member and leader


Currently, we cannot provide a visa for this position. 




## Undergraduate students

The lab often has openings for undergraduate students at UNH to contribute to projects or design a project for an undergraduate thesis/research experience. These can be paid or count as course credits. These projects are typically co-designed by the student, QMEL graduate students, and Professor Easton White. The students most likely to be accepted for a position are those with a keen interest in developing quantitative skills in the context of marine systems. If you are interested, please send <Easton.White@unh.edu> a CV and brief introduction, including details of your prior research experience, as well as your research interests and goals and how you think these align with my research program.


## Graduate students

I will likely accept two graduate students to start Fall 2023. The first student will work in mathematical ecology with applications to spatial ecology and metapopulation biology using oysters as a case study. The second student could work on one of three possible questions: 1) small scale fisheries management, 2) the role of extreme events in marine systems, or 3) the effect of COVID-19 on sustainable seafood. Applicants that will be the most competitive for a position will have experience (and willingness to learn more) with R, quantitative skills (e.g., mathematical modeling, statistics), and field work. A basic understanding of Spanish is a plus for some of the lab's projects. If you are interested, please send <Easton.White@unh.edu> a CV and brief introduction, including details of your prior research experience, as well as your research interests and graduate school goals and how you think these align with my research program. I am also open to chatting about potential projects related to other areas of my research program. 

I can accept students through [UNH's Biological Sciences MS and PhD programs.](https://colsa.unh.edu/biological-sciences) There are specific programs in Integrative Biology (IB) and Marine Biology (MB). The priority deadline for Fall admission is January 15th each year. Although less common, I can also accept student through the [Oceanography](https://ceps.unh.edu/earth-sciences/academics) and [Integrated Applied Mathematics](https://ceps.unh.edu/integrated-applied-mathematics/academics) programs at UNH. If you are interested in working with me, I strongly recommended that you reach out to me before applying for graduate study. Graduate work is typically funded through a combination of fellowships, research positions, and teaching assistantships. 

Depending on your specific interests, I might not be the best advisor for you at UNH. You may also want to reach out to [Dr. Melissa Aikens (plants, biology education)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/melissa-aikens), [Dr. Elizabeth Fairchild (fish, fisheries)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/elizabeth-fairchild), [Dr. Nathan Furey (fishes, sharks, animal movement)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/nathan-furey), [Dr. Elizabeth Harvey (phytoplankton, harmful algal blooms)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/elizabeth-harvey), [Dr. Brittany Jellison (marine invertebrates, intertidal systems, climate change)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/brittany-jellison), [Dr. Gregg Moore (marine plants, restoration)](https://colsa.unh.edu/person/gregg-moore), and others in the [Biology Department](https://colsa.unh.edu/biological-sciences/people) or within the [College of Life Science And Agriculture](https://colsa.unh.edu/). 


## Postdoctoral fellows

Conditional on funding, I will likely soon be looking for postdoctoral fellows to work on questions related to fisheries and disturbances, mathematical modeling of disturbances and socio-environmental systems, improving population monitoring and data collection, sustainable seafood, or synthesizing across socio-environmental fisheries. My background is in quantitative ecology with an emphasis on marine systems. However, my interests are broad and I am happy to discuss other project ideas further. I am also open to collaboratively working on proposals to help fund independent postdoctoral fellow positions through several different programs.

- [Shoals Marine Lab Scientist-in-Residence Fellowship](https://www.shoalsmarinelaboratory.org/sirf) - due Apr 22nd
- [Gund postdoctoral fellow program (based at the University of Vermont)](http://go.uvm.edu/nia9k) - due Nov 11th
- [NSF Ocean Sciences postdoctoral fellow program (based anywhere)](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ocean-sciences-postdoctoral-research-fellowships-oce-prf-0) - Due Nov 11th each year
- [Fulbright Program](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) - this is for non-US residents to study and work in the US - due in October each year
- [Human Frontier Science Program postdoctoral fellowship](https://www.hfsp.org/funding/hfsp-funding/postdoctoral-fellowships) - intended for interdisciplinary scholars working in the life sciences - due August of each year
- [Schmidt Science Fellows postdoctoral program](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/selection/)
- [Smith Fellowship program](https://conbio.org/mini-sites/smith-fellows) - Conservation-focused award due in October each year
- [JSMF's Understanding Dynamic and Multi-scale Systems program](https://www.jsmf.org/apply/fellowship/) - Postdoc fellowship due in June each year
- [JHU Early career researcher funding database](https://research.jhu.edu/rdt/funding-opportunities/early-career/) 

If you are interested, please send an email and CV to Easton White (<Easton.White@unh.edu>).
